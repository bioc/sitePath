\usage{
similarityMatrix(tree)

sneakPeek(tree, step = 10, maxPath = NULL, minPath = 1, makePlot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The return from \code{\link{addMSA}} function}

\item{step}{the 'similarity' window for calculating and ploting. To better
see the impact of threshold on path number. The default is 10.}

\item{maxPath}{maximum number of path to return show in the plot. The number of path
in the raw tree can be far greater than trimmed tree. To better
see the impact of threshold on path number. This is preferably
specified. The default is one 20th of tree tip number.}

\item{minPath}{minimum number of path to return show in the plot. To better
see the impact of threshold on path number. The default is 1.}

\item{makePlot}{whether make a dot plot when return}
}
\value{
\code{similarityMatrix} returns a diagonal matrix of
similarity between sequences

\code{sneakPeek} return the similarity threhold against number of lineagePath.
There will be a simple dot plot between threshold and path number if
\code{makePlot} is TRUE.
}
\description{
\code{similarityMatrix} calculates similarity between aligned sequences
The similarity matrix can be used in \code{\link{groupTips}}
or \code{\link{lineagePath}}

\code{sneakPeek} is intended to plot 'similarity' (actually the least
percentage of 'major SNP') as a threshold against number of output
lineagePath. This plot is intended to give user a rought view about
how many lineages they could expect from the 'similarity' threshold in
the function \code{\link{lineagePath}}. The number of lineagePath is
preferably not be too many or too few. The result excludes where the
number of lineagePath is greater than number of tips divided by 20 or
user-defined maxPath. The zero lineagePath result will also be excluded.
