Description: The package does hierarchical search for fixation and parallel
    mutations given multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. In viral
    evolution, fixed substitutions in the nucleic acid or protein level are
    closely associated with maintaining viral function, while parallel mutation
    reflects the competitive nature in adaptive selection. In sitePath, the
    phylogenetic tree was separated into a set of inheritable phylogenetic
    pathways via an automated pathway-division method. Then, for each
    phylogenetic pathway, the identification of fixed substitutions was
    transformed into a local-optimal-solution problem directed by a minimal
    entropy algorithm. Finally, the parallel mutation was determined based on
    the recurrence of mutations among at least two phylogenetic pathways.
